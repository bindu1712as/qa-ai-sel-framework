# AI-Assisted Selenium Automation Framework

## Overview
This project demonstrates a production-style Selenium automation framework
enhanced with Machine Learning for intelligent test analytics.

## Target Companies
Designed specifically for AI-driven SaaS products such as **Netskope, Freshworks, and Salesforce**.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium
- Pytest
- SQL
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## Key Features
- Selenium UI automation using Page Object Model
- ML-based flaky test detection and regression prioritization
- SQL backend data validation
- CI/CD ready architecture for automated test execution

## Capstone Project Purpose
- Reduce test execution time by predicting flaky tests
- Ensure UI actions correctly update backend databases
- Integrate ML analytics into automated test workflows
- Provide actionable insights for AI product QA teams

## How This Framework Aligns With Target Companies
